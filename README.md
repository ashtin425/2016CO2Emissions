# 2016CO2Emissions
For this project I used a Kaggle dataset that gathered data on energy consumption and CO2 emissions from each country in the year 2016. Before I started quering the data I asked myself a few questions I wanted answered:
- What are the top countries with the highest energy consumption
- What are the top countries that use renewables, oil consumption, coal consumption, and gas consumption
- What is the average of renewables used per country
- What are the top countries contributing to CO2 emissions.

After I ran my queries, I copied the tables into Excel and saved them to use for potential visualizations.
